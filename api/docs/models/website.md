# Website

The `Website` class represents a website entity with properties such as name, slug, description, image, and an embedding vector. It includes methods to initialize the model, find similar websites based on an embedding, and hooks for creating and updating website instances.

## Methods

| Name       | Parameters                  | Return Type            | Description                                      |

| getSimilar | searchTerm: string, skip: number = 0, limit: number = 9999 | Promise<Website[]> | Finds and returns similar websites based on the search term's embedding. |
| initModel  | -                           | void                   | Initializes the Website model with its schema and options. |

## Hooks

- `beforeCreate`: Before creating a new website instance, this hook generates an embedding for the website based on its name and description.
- `beforeUpdate`: Before updating an existing website instance, this hook updates the embedding for the website based on its name and description.

## Examples

```typescript
// Example usage of initializing the Website model
Website.initModel();

// Example usage of finding similar websites
const similarWebsites = await Website.getSimilar("search term", 0, 10);
```

Note: The actual implementation of the `DataTypes.VECTOR` type and the `sequelize` instance are not provided in the example. The `@ts-ignore` comments indicate that TypeScript type checking is being ignored for these lines.
