# AgentSolutions

AgentSolutions is a class that extends the BaseAgent class and is responsible for processing various stages of solution generation and evaluation within an innovation engine. It manages the memory state for the innovation process and delegates tasks to specific processors based on the current stage.

## Properties

| Name   | Type                             | Description                                   |
|--------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| memory | IEngineInnovationMemoryData      | Holds the state of the innovation process.    |

## Methods

| Name              | Parameters        | Return Type | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| initializeMemory  | job: Job          | Promise<void> | Initializes the memory with the job data and saves it.                      |
| setStage          | stage: IEngineStageTypes | Promise<void> | Sets the current stage in the memory and updates the start time for the stage. |
| process           | -                 | Promise<void> | Processes the current stage by delegating to the appropriate processor.     |

## Examples

```typescript
// Example usage of the AgentSolutions class
import { Job } from "bullmq";

const job = new Job(); // Job should be instantiated with appropriate data
const agentSolutions = new AgentSolutions();

// Initialize memory with job data
await agentSolutions.initializeMemory(job);

// Set the current stage
await agentSolutions.setStage("create-pros-cons");

// Process the current stage
await agentSolutions.process();
```

Note: The example above assumes that the `Job` object is instantiated with the necessary data and that the `AgentSolutions` class is used within an environment where the `Job` class from "bullmq" is available. The actual implementation details such as job data structure and environment setup are not shown in this example.
