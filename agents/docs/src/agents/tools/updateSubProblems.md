# RedisProjectLoader

This class is responsible for loading project data into Redis. It retrieves a project ID from command-line arguments, fetches the corresponding project data from Redis, updates specific sub-problems within the project's memory data, and then saves the updated data back to Redis.

## Properties

No properties are documented as this is a script with functions and not a class with properties.

## Methods

## Examples

// Example usage:
// node script.js projectId123

// The script will connect to Redis, update the project data, and then exit.
```

Please note that this script is not a class and does not have a typical class structure. It is a standalone script meant to be run from the command line. The `loadProject` function is the main entry point of the script.
