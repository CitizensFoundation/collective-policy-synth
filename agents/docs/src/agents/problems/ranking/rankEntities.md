# RankEntitiesProcessor

The `RankEntitiesProcessor` class extends `BasePairwiseRankingsProcessor` and is responsible for ranking entities based on how significantly they are impacted by a given sub-problem. It uses a language model to analyze and compare entities, and then decides which one is more significantly impacted.

## Properties

| Name   | Type   | Description               |

| voteOnPromptPair  | subProblemIndex: number, promptPair: number[] | Promise<IEnginePairWiseVoteResults> | Analyzes a pair of entities and decides which one is more significantly impacted. |
| process           | -                                 | Promise<void>                   | Processes the ranking of entities for all subproblems.                       |

## Examples

```typescript
// Example usage of RankEntitiesProcessor
const rankEntitiesProcessor = new RankEntitiesProcessor();

// Assuming appropriate context and setup has been provided
await rankEntitiesProcessor.process();
```

Note: The `IEnginePairWiseVoteResults`, `IEngineAffectedEntity`, and other related types are not defined in the provided code snippet. They should be defined elsewhere in the codebase, and their definitions would be necessary to fully understand the usage of this class.
