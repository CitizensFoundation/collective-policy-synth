# AgentSolutions

This class extends `BaseAgentProcessor` to handle various stages of solution processing in a policy synthesis context. It manages the lifecycle of solution-related tasks such as creating, ranking, and evolving solutions based on the current stage stored in memory.

## Properties

| Name    | Type             | Description               |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------|
| memory  | PsBaseMemoryData | Holds the state and data needed for processing solutions across different stages. |

## Methods

| Name             | Parameters        | Return Type | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| initializeMemory | job: Job          | Promise<void> | Initializes the memory with job-specific data and default values.           |
| setStage         | stage: PsMemoryStageTypes | Promise<void> | Sets the current processing stage in memory and updates the start time.     |
| process          | -                 | Promise<void> | Processes the current stage's task by delegating to the appropriate processor based on `currentStage`. |

## Example

```typescript
// Example usage of AgentSolutions
import { Job } from "bullmq";
import { AgentSolutions } from '@policysynth/agents/solutions/solutions.js';

const job = new Job(); // Assuming job is already defined and configured elsewhere
const agentSolutions = new AgentSolutions();

(async () => {
  await agentSolutions.setup(job);
  await agentSolutions.process();
})();
```
