It appears there was a misunderstanding. The provided content does not contain a TypeScript class, properties, methods, or any API route information that can be documented in the requested Markdown API documentation format. The content is a JavaScript module primarily configuring and exporting a `winston` logger instance, and it does not match the criteria for generating API documentation as per the example format provided.

If you have a TypeScript file with classes, properties, and methods intended for API documentation, please provide that for documentation generation.
