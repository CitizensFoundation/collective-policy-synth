This TypeScript file does not directly define a class, properties, or methods in the traditional object-oriented programming sense. Instead, it's a script that primarily interacts with Redis to fetch data and then processes and exports that data to a CSV file. Given the nature of the script, the documentation will focus on the main functional aspects and the types involved in the process.

## Functions

| Name  | Parameters | Return Type | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| main  | None       | Promise<void> | The main function of the script. It fetches project data from Redis and exports sub-problems to a CSV file. |

## Types

### IEngineInnovationMemoryData

This type is mentioned but not defined within the provided script. Based on usage, it likely includes the following properties:

| Name          | Type                         | Description               |
|---------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| subProblems   | ISubProblem[]                | An array of sub-problems associated with the project. |

### ISubProblem

This type is implied from the usage within `IEngineInnovationMemoryData`. It likely includes the following properties:

| Name                      | Type   | Description               |
|---------------------------|--------|---------------------------|
| description               | string | A brief description of the sub-problem. |
| title                     | string | The title of the sub-problem. |
| whyIsSubProblemImportant  | string | Explanation of why the sub-problem is important. |
| eloRating                 | string | The Elo rating of the sub-problem. |
| fromSearchType            | string | The search type from which the sub-problem originated. |

## Example

```typescript
// Example usage to export sub-problems to a CSV file
import { main } from '@policysynth/agents/problems/tools/exportSubProblems.js';

// Assuming the environment is correctly set up with REDIS_MEMORY_URL
// and the necessary command line arguments are provided:
// node exportSubProblems.js <projectId> <outputFilePath>

main().catch(err => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

Note: This example assumes that the script is modularized to export the `main` function, which is not directly reflected in the provided script. Adjustments to the script might be necessary for this example to be applicable.
