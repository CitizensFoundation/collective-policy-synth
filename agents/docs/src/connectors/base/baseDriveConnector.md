# PsBaseDriveConnector

The `PsBaseDriveConnector` is an abstract class that serves as a base connector for Drive-like services. It defines the essential methods that all drive connectors need to implement, such as listing, retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting files or objects.

## Properties

This class does not define any properties. It inherits properties from the `PsBaseConnector` class.

## Methods

| Name   | Parameters                          | Return Type   | Description                                                                 |
|--------|-------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| list   | None                                | Promise<any[]> | Lists drive files or objects. Returns a promise that resolves to an array or a custom data structure. |
| get    | fileId: string                      | Promise<any>  | Retrieves a drive file or object by its ID.                                 |
| post   | data: any                           | Promise<any>  | Creates (posts) a new file or object on the drive.                          |
| put    | fileId: string, data: any           | Promise<any>  | Updates (puts) an existing file/object on the drive.                        |
| delete | fileId: string                      | Promise<void> | Deletes a file/object from the drive.                                       |

## Example

```typescript
import { PsBaseDriveConnector } from '@policysynth/agents/connectors/base/baseDriveConnector.js';

class MyDriveConnector extends PsBaseDriveConnector {
  async list(): Promise<any[]> {
    // Implementation for listing files
  }

  async get(fileId: string): Promise<any> {
    // Implementation for retrieving a file by ID
  }

  async post(data: any): Promise<any> {
    // Implementation for creating a new file
  }

  async put(fileId: string, data: any): Promise<any> {
    // Implementation for updating an existing file
  }

  async delete(fileId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation for deleting a file
  }
}
```

In this example, `MyDriveConnector` extends `PsBaseDriveConnector` and provides concrete implementations for the abstract methods defined in the base class. This allows for interaction with a specific Drive-like service by implementing the necessary logic for each method.
