# Collective Policy Synth
## Bringing together the best of collective and artificial intelligence

## More Information
Our project is an ambitious endeavor to meld human insights with the power of AI to tackle complex policy issues. We're working towards creating a platform where policymakers, citizens, and AI can collectively interact to accelerate and enhance the decision-making process.

### Resources
- [Figma Prototype Design](https://www.figma.com/file/ekIKXfT3tL8Ab7MoLSnjnN/Collective-Policy-Synth-V10)
- [Live: First Test Results](https://collective-policy-synth.citizens.is/projects/1/)

## Prototype Design
The first test run is entirely automated except for the problem statement provided by humans. All other components are generated using GPT-4 & GPT-3.5. The context for solutions is obtained through curated web searches. This setup allows us to explore how human and AI-driven insights can work together to solve complex problems.

## Project Status
- **Implemented**: Problem identification and solution modules 
- **Testing**: We're currently running initial tests
- **In Progress**: Initial crowdsourcing components for pairwise voting, idea generation, and debate
- **Planned**: First iteration of the policy ideas modules

## Future Timeline
- **Mid-August 2023**: Plan to release initial crowdsourcing components
- **End of August 2023**: First iteration of the policy ideas modules
