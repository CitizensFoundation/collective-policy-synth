## The mission & passion behind Policy Synth
### Bringing together the best of collective and artificial intelligence

Policy Synth aims to help governments and citizens make better decisions together by seamlessly integrating collective and artificial intelligence. Utilizing our top-rated community engagement solutions, over 50 x LLM agent types, and genetic algorithms. The drive and passion behind Policy Synth represents a distinctive effort to intertwine human insights with artificial intelligence in addressing complex policy dilemmas. We are currently developing a state-of-the-art platform where policymakers, citizens, and AI can partake in collective discourse.

## Top-Rated Community Engagement Platforms

### Your Priorities
Policy Synth utilizes "Your Priorities", a platform we've been refining since 2008. It's recognized as the world's leading citizen engagement tool.

- Rated #1 on PeoplePowered: [2024 Platform Ratings](https://www.peoplepowered.org/platform-ratings)
- Top ranking in the [2024 Digital Democracy Report](https://www.solonian-institute.com/publications)
- Top listing in [OECD Guidelines for Citizen Participation Processes](https://www.oecd.org/publications/oecd-guidelines-for-citizen-participation-processes-f765caf6-en.htm)

### All Our Ideas
Policy Synth makes use of All Our Ideas, Citizens Foundations open source, human, pairwise voting platform, to provide guidance and input into different AI agents.

## First test run: Democracy in Distress
The first test run is entirely automated, except for the problem statement provided by us. All sub-problems, entities, and solutions—complete with pros and cons—are generated using GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. These models run highly specialized agents that are, at the moment, very basic and therefore reliable, and should not be confused with ongoing, and exciting, LLM autonomous agent experiments. The context for solutions is obtained through curated web searches. This setup allows us to explore how human and AI-driven insights can work together to solve complex problems.

We're also experimenting with genetic algorithms to foster a co-evolution of solutions between AI and citizens. We use large language models to implement random mutations and crossover, creating a vibrant and diverse pool of potential policy solutions. Fitness ranking is performed by both humans and AI, with the human ranking weighting higher.

To further enrich our evolving solution space, we introduce fresh random immigration through solutions acquired via web searches. This process infuses new ideas and perspectives into our evolving policy generation, enhancing its capacity to tackle a wide range of issues.

For the real-world application of our platform, a series of expert and mass citizen crowdsourcing stages will be integrated. These stages are designed to accompany the AI-generated and ranked options. This multifaceted approach combines collective human insights, expert opinions, and machine intelligence. Our model leverages technology to harness collective wisdom, effectively facilitating the development and implementation of well-informed policy decisions.
