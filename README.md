# Collective Policy Synth
## Bringing together the best of collective and artificial intelligence

## More Information
This project aims to combine human insights with the power of AI to address complex policy issues.

## Prototype Design
The first test run is entirely automated except for the problem statement provided by humans. All other components are generated using GPT-4 & GPT-3.5. The context for solutions is obtained through curated web searches. This setup allows us to explore how human and AI-driven insights can work together to solve complex problems.

## Project Status
- **Implemented**: Problem identification and solution modules 
- **Testing**: We're currently running initial tests
- **In Progress**: Initial crowdsourcing components for pairwise voting, idea generation, and debate
- **Planned**: First iteration of the policy ideas modules

## Future Timeline
- **Mid-August 2023**: Plan to release initial crowdsourcing components
- **End of August 2023**: First iteration of the policy ideas modules
