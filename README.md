# Policy Synth

## Bringing together the best of collective and artificial intelligence

Utilizing our top-rated citizen engagement solutions, over 30 GPT-4 agent types, and advanced genetic algorithms, Policy Synth represents a distinctive effort to intertwine human insights with artificial intelligence in addressing complex policy dilemmas. We are currently developing a state-of-the-art platform where policymakers, citizens, and AI can partake in collective discourse. This collaborative interaction is anticipated to expedite decision-making processes and also enhance their quality, thereby paving the way for more innovative and effective policy solutions.

## First test run
The first test run is entirely automated except for the problem statement provided by us. All sub problems, entities and solutions with pros & cons are generated using GPT-4 & GPT-3.5 running highly specilized agents. The context for solutions is obtained through curated web searches. This setup allows us to explore how human and AI-driven insights can work together to solve complex problems.

We're also experimenting with genetic algorithms to foster a co-evolution of solutions between AI and citizens. We use large language models to implement random mutations and crossover, creating a vibrant and diverse pool of potential policy solutions. Fitness ranking is performed by both humans and AI, with the human ranking weighting higher.

To further enrich our evolving solution space, we introduce fresh random immigration through solutions acquired via web searches. This process infuses new ideas and perspectives into our evolving policy generation, enhancing its capacity to tackle a wide range of issues.

For the real-world application of our platform, a series of expert and mass citizen crowdsourcing stages will be integrated. These stages are designed to accompany the AI-generated and ranked options. This multifaceted approach combines collective human insights, expert opinions, and machine intelligence. Our model leverages technology to harness collective wisdom, effectively facilitating the development and implementation of well-informed policy decisions.

## Project Status
