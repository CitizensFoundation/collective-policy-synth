# Collective Policy Synth
## Bringing together the best of collective and artificial intelligence

## More Information
This project aims to combine human insights with the power of AI to address complex policy issues. We aim to enable policymakers and citizens to effectively engage with AI, facilitating quicker and more innovative decision-making processes.
### Resources
- [Figma Prototype Design](https://www.figma.com/file/ekIKXfT3tL8Ab7MoLSnjnN/Collective-Policy-Synth-V10)
- [Live: First Test Results](https://collective-policy-synth.citizens.is/projects/1/)

## Prototype Design
The first test run is entirely automated except for the problem statement provided by humans. All other components are generated using GPT-4 & GPT-3.5. The context for solutions is obtained through curated web searches. This setup allows us to explore how human and AI-driven insights can work together to solve complex problems.

## Project Status
- **Implemented**: Problem identification and solution modules 
- **Testing**: We're currently running initial tests
- **In Progress**: Initial crowdsourcing components for pairwise voting, idea generation, and debate
- **Planned**: First iteration of the policy ideas modules

## Future Timeline
- **Mid-August 2023**: Plan to release initial crowdsourcing components
- **End of August 2023**: First iteration of the policy ideas modules
