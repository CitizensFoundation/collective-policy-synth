      Open data portals
      Open data portals facilitate access to and reuse of public sector information. They can help encourage cross-border use of reusable data in Europe.

      Open data portals are web-based interfaces designed to make it easier to find reusable information. Like library catalogues, they contain metadata records of datasets published for reuse, mostly relating to information in the form of raw, numerical data rather than textual documents.

      In combination with specific search functionalities, they facilitate finding datasets of interest. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are often available as well, offering direct and automated access to data for software applications.

      Open data portals are an important element of most open data initiatives and are mainly used by public administrations at European, national and local level in EU countries. Notable examples of Open Data portals maintained by public administrations in Europe are:

      opendata.paris.fr
      www.data.gouv.fr
      www.dati.piemonte.it
      www.dati.gov.it
      www.data.overheid.nl
      While supporting policy development by offering easy access to published data, open data portals can also work as a catalyst triggering the publication of more and better quality data. For administrations obliged or willing to disseminate their data, they offer the advantage of providing public access without the need to reply to individual requests for access to data. And, more and more companies are opening up some of their data for developers to reuse.

      The European Commission offers an open data portal for any type of information held by the Commission and other EU institutions and bodies. The European Union's Open Data Portal has been in operation since December 2012.

      The European Data Portal
      The European Commission has funded the European Data Portal through the Connecting Europe Facility programme. The portal is a pan-European repository of public sector information open for reuse in the EU. It offers a training centre on how to reuse open data and a database of success stories from European and international re-users.

      The principal function of the European Data Portal is to provide a single point of access in all 24 EU official languages for data published by public administrations at all levels of government in Europe (EU countries, countries of the European Economic Area and certain other European countries).

      In order to foster comparability of data published across borders, it presents metadata references in a common format (Data Catalog Vocabulary application profile for data portals in Europe), using resource description framework (RDF) technology.  It provides translations of metadata descriptions in all 24 languages using machine-translation technology.

      The portal complements national, regional and thematic open data portals, and the EU's Open Data Portal. Each of these portals target relevant user audiences, offering tailored content. This infrastructure will stimulate cross-border use of reusable information in Europe by improving the findability of data across countries and supporting the development of data applications and products including data from different countries.

        Childhood Overweight & Obesity

        Childhood obesity is a serious health problem in the United States where 1 in 5 children and adolescents are affected. Some groups of children are more affected than others, but all children are at risk of gaining weight that is higher than what is considered healthy.

        Obesity is complex. Many factors can contribute to excess weight gain including behavior, genetics and taking certain medications. But societal and community factors also matter: child care and school environments, neighborhood design, access to healthy, affordable foods and beverages, and access to safe and convenient places for physical activity affect our ability to make healthy choices.

        Every child deserves a healthy start in life. Learn what parents and caregivers can to do help prevent obesity at home, how healthcare systems can help families prevent and manage childhood obesity, and what strategies communities can use to support a healthy, active lifestyle for all.

        Summary
        Increasing the speed of battery formation can significantly lower lithium-ion battery manufacturing costs. However, adopting
        faster formation protocols in practical manufacturing settings is challenging due to a lack of inexpensive, rapid diagnostic
        signals that can inform possible impacts to long-term battery lifetime. This work identifies the cell resistance measured at low
        states of charge as an early-life diagnostic feature for screening new formation protocols. We show that this signal correlates to
        cycle life and improves the accuracy of data-driven battery lifetime prediction models. The signal is obtainable at the end of
        the manufacturing line, takes seconds to acquire, and does not require specialized test equipment. We explore a physical
        connection between this resistance signal and the quantity of lithium consumed during formation, suggesting that the signal
        may be broadly applicable for evaluating any manufacturing process change that could impact the total lithium consumed
        during formation.

        3 Conclusion
        In this work, we demonstrated that low-SOC resistance (RLS) correlates to cycle life across two different battery
        formation protocols. As a predictive feature, RLS provided higher prediction accuracy compared to conventional
        measures of formation quality such as Coulombic efficiency as well as state-of-the art predictive features based
        on changes in discharge voltage curves. RLS is measurable at the end of the manufacturing line using ordinary
        battery test equipment and can be measured within seconds. Changes in RLS are attributed to differences in the
        amount of lithium consumed to the SEI during formation, where a decrease in RLS indicates that more lithium is
        consumed. For more information: Robert Bjarnason with email robert@citizens.is
