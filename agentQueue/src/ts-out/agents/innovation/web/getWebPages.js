        Childhood Overweight & Obesity
        Print
        Childhood obesity is a serious health problem in the United States where 1 in 5 children and adolescents are affected. Some groups of children are more affected than others, but all children are at risk of gaining weight that is higher than what is considered healthy.

        Obesity is complex. Many factors can contribute to excess weight gain including behavior, genetics and taking certain medications. But societal and community factors also matter: child care and school environments, neighborhood design, access to healthy, affordable foods and beverages, and access to safe and convenient places for physical activity affect our ability to make healthy choices.

        Every child deserves a healthy start in life. Learn what parents and caregivers can to do help prevent obesity at home, how healthcare systems can help families prevent and manage childhood obesity, and what strategies communities can use to support a healthy, active lifestyle for all.

        Summary
        Increasing the speed of battery formation can significantly lower lithium-ion battery manufacturing costs. However, adopting
        faster formation protocols in practical manufacturing settings is challenging due to a lack of inexpensive, rapid diagnostic
        signals that can inform possible impacts to long-term battery lifetime. This work identifies the cell resistance measured at low
        states of charge as an early-life diagnostic feature for screening new formation protocols. We show that this signal correlates to
        cycle life and improves the accuracy of data-driven battery lifetime prediction models. The signal is obtainable at the end of
        the manufacturing line, takes seconds to acquire, and does not require specialized test equipment. We explore a physical
        connection between this resistance signal and the quantity of lithium consumed during formation, suggesting that the signal
        may be broadly applicable for evaluating any manufacturing process change that could impact the total lithium consumed
        during formation.

        3 Conclusion
        In this work, we demonstrated that low-SOC resistance (RLS) correlates to cycle life across two different battery
        formation protocols. As a predictive feature, RLS provided higher prediction accuracy compared to conventional
        measures of formation quality such as Coulombic efficiency as well as state-of-the art predictive features based
        on changes in discharge voltage curves. RLS is measurable at the end of the manufacturing line using ordinary
        battery test equipment and can be measured within seconds. Changes in RLS are attributed to differences in the
        amount of lithium consumed to the SEI during formation, where a decrease in RLS indicates that more lithium is
        consumed.
