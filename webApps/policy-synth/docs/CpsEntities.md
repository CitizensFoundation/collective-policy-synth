# About file/class

The `CpsEntities` class is a custom element that extends the `CpsStageBase` class. It is responsible for rendering and managing the UI related to sub-problems and entities within a problem-solving context. The class includes properties for tracking the active entity and sub-problem, methods for rendering different parts of the UI, and lifecycle callbacks for managing global activities.

# Properties

- `activeEntityIndex: number | null`: Holds the index of the currently active entity. It is initialized to `null`.
- `maxNumberOfTopEntities: number`: Represents the maximum number of top entities to display prominently. It is initialized to `4`.

# Methods with parameters

- `connectedCallback(): void`: Lifecycle method that is called when the element is added to the document's DOM. It sets the `maxNumberOfTopEntities` based on the `groupId` and logs an activity.
- `updated(changedProperties: Map<string | number | symbol, unknown>): void`: Lifecycle method that is called after the element's properties have changed. It calls the `super.updated` method.
- `disconnectedCallback(): void`: Lifecycle method that is called when the element is removed from the document's DOM. It logs an activity.
- `render(): unknown`: Renders the UI based on the current state of the active entity index and sub-problem index.
- `renderSubProblemScreen(subProblem: IEngineSubProblem): unknown`: Renders the UI for a specific sub-problem.
- `renderEntityScreen(entity: IEngineAffectedEntity): unknown`: Renders the UI for a specific entity.

# Example usage

```typescript
import { CpsEntities } from './path-to-cps-entities';

// Assuming `CpsEntities` is already defined as a custom element
const cpsEntitiesElement = document.createElement('cps-entities');
document.body.appendChild(cpsEntitiesElement);

// Set properties or interact with the element as needed
cpsEntitiesElement.activeEntityIndex = 2;
```

Note: The actual usage of the `CpsEntities` class would depend on the context in which it is used, including the surrounding application logic and the structure of the data it is meant to handle.
