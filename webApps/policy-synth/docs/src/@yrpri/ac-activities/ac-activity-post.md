# AcActivityPost

`AcActivityPost` is a custom web component that extends `YpPostBaseWithAnswers`, which in turn extends `AcActivityWithGroupBase`. It represents a post within an activity, including a cover media, post name, description, and potentially a group header. It is styled to display the post information and allows users to navigate to the post's detail page when clicked.
