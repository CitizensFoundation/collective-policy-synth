# AcActivities

The `AcActivities` class is a custom element that displays a list of activities, such as posts or news stories, within a domain, community, group, post, or user collection. It supports infinite scrolling, loading more data as the user scrolls down. It also provides a way for logged-in users to add new posts and recommends posts based on the collection type.
