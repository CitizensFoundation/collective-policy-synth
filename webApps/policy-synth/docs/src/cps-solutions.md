# CpsSolutions

The `CpsSolutions` class is a custom element that extends the `CpsStageBase` class. It is responsible for displaying and managing the solutions related to sub-problems within a problem-solving context. It allows users to filter, search, and navigate through different generations of solutions, view detailed information about each solution, and interact with a family tree visualization of the solutions' evolution.

## Examples

```typescript
// Example usage of the cps-solutions custom element
<cps-solutions></cps-solutions>
```

Note: The actual usage of the `CpsSolutions` class would involve setting up the necessary properties and integrating it within a larger application context where it interacts with other components and services.
