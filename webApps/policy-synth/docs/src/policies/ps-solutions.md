# PsSolutions

The `PsSolutions` class is a custom element that extends the `PsStageBase` class. It is responsible for displaying and managing solutions related to sub-problems within a problem-solving application. The class includes properties for managing UI state, such as dropdown visibility, search text, and active solution indices. It also handles user interactions like button clicks, swipes, and keyboard events.

```

Note: The actual implementation of the `PsSolutions` class includes additional private methods and properties, as well as rendering logic using Lit's `html` and `css` tagged template literals. The class also interacts with other components and services, such as `window.psAppGlobals` and `window.psServerApi`, which are not detailed in this documentation.
