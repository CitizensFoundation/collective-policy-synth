## Examples

```typescript
// Example usage of the CpsSolutions custom element
<yps-solutions></yps-solutions>
```

Please note that the above example is a simple usage scenario. The actual use of the `CpsSolutions` element involves interaction with its properties and methods, which would typically be done within a larger application context.
