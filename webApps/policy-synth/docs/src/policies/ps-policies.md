# PsPolicies

The `PsPolicies` class is a custom element that extends the `CpsStageBase` class. It is responsible for displaying and managing the policies within a problem-solving stage. The component allows users to filter, search, and navigate through different generations of policies, view detailed information about each policy, and interact with policy groups.

## Examples

```typescript
// Example usage of the PsPolicies custom element
<ps-policies></ps-policies>
```

Note: The above example is a simple usage scenario. The actual usage would involve setting up the necessary properties and handling events to integrate the `PsPolicies` component into a larger application.
